"""A simple mathematical description of the spread of a disease in a population is the so-called SIR model, which divides the (fixed) population of N individuals into three "compartments" which may vary as a function of time, t:

S(t) are those susceptible but not yet infected with the disease;
I(t) is the number of infectious individuals;
R(t) are those individuals who have recovered from the disease and now have immunity to it.
The SIR model describes the change in the population of each of these compartments in terms of two parameters, β and γ.
β describes the effective contact rate of the disease: an infected individual comes into contact with βN other individuals per unit time
(of which the fraction that are susceptible to contracting the disease is S/N).
γ is the mean recovery rate: that is, 1/γ is the mean period of time during which an infected individual can pass it on.

The differential equations describing this model were first derived by Kermack and McKendrick [Proc. R. Soc. A, 115, 772 (1927)]
The following Python code integrates these equations for a disease characterised by parameters
β=0.2, 1/γ=10days in a population of N=1000 (perhaps 'flu in a school). The model is started with a single infected individual on day 0: I(0)=1.
The plotted curves of S(t), I(t) and R(t) are styled to look a bit nicer than Matplotlib's defaults."""
